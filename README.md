# Library Management System

This project is an implementation of a Library Management System inspired by the design principles outlined in the [Library Management System](https://github.com/ycwkatie/OOD-Object-Oriented-Design/blob/main/ood/library_management.md) from the OOD-Object-Oriented-Design repository. It provides functionalities for managing books, members, loans, and fines within a library setting.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Add and manage book details such as title, author, and availability status 
- **Member Management**: Register and manage library members with unique IDs and names 
- **Fine Calculation**: Automatically calculate fines for overdue books based on predefined rates 

## Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd library-management-system
   ```

3. **Open the project in your preferred Java IDE**.

4. **Build and run the project** to ensure all dependencies are correctly set up.

## Usage

The system can be simulated using the `LibrarySystem` class, which demonstrates the process of issuing a book, returning it after a certain period, and processing any applicable fines. For detailed code examples and implementation, please refer to the source files in the repository
